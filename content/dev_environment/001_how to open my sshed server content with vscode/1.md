To open your SSH server and its contents in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), follow these steps:

### 1. Install the **Remote - SSH** Extension

- Open VS Code.
- Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
- Search for "**Remote - SSH**" and install it.

### 2. Set Up SSH Connection

- Once the extension is installed, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette.
- Type `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...` and select it.
- If this is your first time connecting, you'll need to add a new SSH host. Enter your SSH connection string in the format:

  ```bash
  user@hostname
  ```

  For example:

  ```bash
  user@192.168.1.10
  ```

- VS Code will prompt you to choose the SSH configuration file to update (`~/.ssh/config`). If you don't have one, it will create it for you.

### 3. Authenticate and Connect

- VS Code will attempt to connect to your SSH server. It will ask you for the password or use your SSH key (if configured).
- Once authenticated, a new VS Code window will open connected to your SSH server.

### 4. Open Files/Folders on the Remote Server

- In the new VS Code window, you will see a `Remote Explorer` in the sidebar where you can browse the server's directory.
- You can open files or entire folders on the SSH server just like you would with your local file system.

### 5. Optional: Configure SSH Keys for Passwordless Access

For easier access, you can set up SSH keys so you don't have to enter your password every time. You can generate SSH keys with:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

Then add the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server, and you'll be able to connect without needing to type a password.
